## Overcomplete Recurrent Infomax Neural Network

* [Infomax.m](https://github.com/bci4cpl/Demos/blob/master/Overcomplete%20Recurrent%20Infomax%20Neural%20Network/Infomax.m) contains a simple object-oriented implementation of the overcomplete recurrent Infomax neural network as presented in [Shriki, O., Sompolinsky, H., & Lee, D. D. (2001). An information maximization approach to overcomplete and recurrent representations. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 612-618).](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1863-an-information-maximization-approach-to-overcomplete-and-recurrent-representations)

* [Demo.m](https://github.com/bci4cpl/Demos/blob/master/Overcomplete%20Recurrent%20Infomax%20Neural%20Network/Demo.m) implements the hexagon example from the aforementioned paper.
