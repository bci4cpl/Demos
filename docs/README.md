## Overcomplete Recurrent Infomax Neural Network

(tested on Matlab versions R2013a to R2017b). 

Based on the paper: [Shriki, O., Sompolinsky, H., & Lee, D. D. (2001). An information maximization approach to overcomplete and recurrent representations. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 612-618).](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1863-an-information-maximization-approach-to-overcomplete-and-recurrent-representations)
